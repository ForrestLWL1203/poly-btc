# to-week stability, copyability, loss-discipline) is the PROFILE stage's job (pos_day_ratio, grid gate,
# worst_loss gate). Key lessons baked in: (1) bots/grids are INVISIBLE here (volume/turnover/efficiency
# don't separate them from directional — proven), so don't try; profile catches them. (2) ACTIVITY uses
# the 7d window, NOT 24h — a 24h floor kills the holders we want (low 24h volume mid-hold) and biases to
# high-churn bots. (3) RETURN uses 30d magnitude + 7d magnitude TOGETHER: 30d alone can be one big early
# day then dormant; requiring the 7d to ALSO be earning blocks that, while the 30d requirement stops a
# single-week fluke. We copy by %/leverage so low-ROI wallets give us low returns (small capital).

# that produced a 90→20 cliff). User principles: the roots are 胜率 / 风险调整ROI / 逐日稳定性 / 活跃度(样本);
# the temp hard gates (loss_pain/hold_skew/profit_conc) are FOLDED IN as smooth factors, not vetoes:
#   score01 = (W_WIN·win + W_ROI·roiS + W_STAB·stab) × evidence × g_frag × g_deep × survival      ∈ [0,1]
#   display = round(score01 × 100).  Native scale is now [0,1] (was [0,3]); score100 = ×100.
# Smooth because the core is an ADDITIVE weighted blend of [0,1] factors (no capped ratio, no power law),
# and the guards/evidence are gentle multipliers with floors (a single flaw discounts, never zeroes).
# v6 (2026-07-02): the THREE roots are 胜率 / 活跃度 / ROI (user). 活跃度 promoted from evidence-multiplier
# to a CORE term; 逐日稳定性 dropped. NO 反噬/worst-loss guard — 小赚大亏 already shows as low/neg ROI
# (net≤0 gated; low ROI → low ROI term). We copy ISOLATED + our own stop, so their single big loss doesn't
